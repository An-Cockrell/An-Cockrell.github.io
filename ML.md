<h3>The An-Cockrell Lab is a Funded Team in the <a href="https://triagechallenge.darpa.mil/index">DARPA Triage Challenge</a> for the Data Competition Track, with <a href="https://www.medicaldigitaltwins.ai/people.html">Dr. Cockrell</a> as the Primary Investigator.</h3>

The DARPA Triage Challenge (DTC) aims to revolutionize medical triage in mass casualty incidents (civilian and military) through the use of technology. The goal is to foster the development of algorithms and sensors for rapid, accurate injury identification. This initiative targets enhancements in stand-off and sensor-based triage, critical in scenarios where medical resources are scarce or overwhelmed.

Within this broader initiative, the DTC Data Competition specifically seeks to develop algorithms which are capable of detecting potential physiological decompensation from biomedical signal data. This would allow for the targeting of scarce resources to those patients who will benefit most. This competition emphasizes the importance of early intervention in pre-hospital settings to save lives, focusing on conditions that can be temporized in the field with a large impact on survival.
