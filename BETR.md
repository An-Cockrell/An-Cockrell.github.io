<h5>Volumetric Muscle Loss injury is a debilitating injury marked by significant loss of functionality in affected tissues. The Regenerative Electronic Platform through Advanced Intelligent Regulation (REPAIR) project aims to enhance the regrowth of functional muscle through an AI agent trained with a high-resolution simulation model (the Wound Environment Agent-based Model or WEABM) that recieves input regarding the spatially discrete molecular state of the wound and determines the activation of cell factories engineered to produce a set of pro-, anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and anti-fibrotic agents. This overall structure is compliant with the definition of a Digital Twin as per the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report from 2024. </h5>
